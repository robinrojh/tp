*Networkers* is a **desktop app for managing contacts for networks, 
optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) 
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, Networkers can get your contact management tasks 
done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Deleting a client: `deleteClient`

Deletes a specified client from  the contact book.

Format: `deleteClient <INDEX>`

* Deletes the client at the specified INDEX.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.
* The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …

User must then type `confirm` in order to delete the client. Users may type cancel instead to return to the main command line.

Examples:

### Add a Procedure to a Client: `addProc`

Adds a specified procedure to a specified client list in the contact book.

**Format:** `addProc <Client Index> <Procedure>`
* `addProc` refers to the command of adding a procedure to the client at the specified Index.
* `<Client Index>` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. The index **must be** a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
* `<Procedure>` refers to the tasks or problems that need to be addressed in the future visits to the client’s business sight.
  * Note that a client’s list of procedures is a numbered list. A new procedure will be added on to the existing numbered list (to the last index).

**Example:** <br/>
Non-GUI Format:
* `addProc 1 Check router’s connection with the modem`
  * In the case that the 1st client already has existing procedures, `Check router’s connection with the modem` procedure will appear to be the last procedure in that client’s procedure list.

###Delete a Procedure from the client: deleteProc
Deletes a procedure associated with the client. This is important as it allows the user to maintain and make changes to the database - creation and deletion.

Format: deleteProc <clientIndex> <Proc Index>
deleteProc refers to the command of adding a procedure to the client at the specified Index.
<Client Index> refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
<Procedure> refers to the tasks or problems that need to be addressed in the future visits to the client’s business sight.
Note that a client’s list of procedures is a numbered list. A new procedure will be added on to the existing numbered list (to the last index).

Example:

Non-GUI format:
User: deleteProc 1 3
Terminal returns: The procedure “Bring a new Singtel router to replace the old Apple one” has been successfully deleted! :)
User: deleteProc 3 500
Terminal returns: The procedure you listed does not exist, add more procedures.
User: deleteProc 3
Terminal returns: Do add in the procedure you would like to delete and try again :).

### View All Clients and Procedures: `list`

Lists out all the clients and their respective procedures saved. 
This feature will be used to show clients on GUI. No arguments required.
Example: 
- User: `list`
